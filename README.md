Module 1 - Assessment
=====================

Developer: Varun Gupta
----------------------

This is the ReadMe.md for the project below. The main purpose of this document is to provide evidence of the work performed to meet the Module 1 Assessment criterias.

Project name: Eclectic\* Cycles
-------------------------------


Purpose of the website: Eclectic Cycles is an online resource that provides information on how users can learn about renting electric cycles as a means of shared-mobility, like a bus or a train. The site provides details information on partners that provides E Cycles as Shared Mobility, where they operate, what types of vehicles they provide and cost.

Catch-phrase: Rent a shared E-Cycle for all your adventures. See how easy it is.

Over the shorter distance, shared E-Cycles has demonstrated itself to be more virtuous than mass public demonstration, by being quicker, more affordable, more flexible and with zero emissions it is also kinder to mother nature.

1\. Project Goals
=================

The purpose of the project is to showcase the benefits of using E-Cycles for daily commute to work, shopping or to just cycle around. Whilst the users understand and acknowledge that using cycles is better for the planet, our research shows they dont really understand that it is also cheaper, quicker, safer and healthier. The users will also learn more about providers and their offering. Finally, the users will be able to plan their journey through cycle routes and coverage of e-cycles on route.

Business Goals:
---------------

*   Build brand/ introduce in the growing area of electric cycles and shared mobility.
*   We are operating a skyscanner type website, for shared electic cycles, where our partners will offer a small fee for the referral.
*   Inform users of the benefits and providers of shared mobility systems and provide addtional information so that users can start their journey sooner.
*   Based on users choice, the user can then book their journey on our partners webiste.
*   Build a community around the website, through the newsletter which they can signup to.

User Goals:
-----------

Users can choose one of our partners who are spread across London to rent an E-Cycle for your next adventure. Why choose Electric Cycles?

*   Get there quickly: Average user takes nearly 1 hour to commute to work. Get on a cycle and cut journey times by half.
*   Safer Journey: With dedicated cycle lanes commuting in busy inner cities is not just faster, but also safer.
*   Greener Planet: Take care of our planet and future generations by riding cycles.
*   More Affordable: A monthly pass costs just GBP 60, less than half the cost of a zone 1-3 tube pass.

2\. UX
======

Target audience
---------------

Cyclists, naturalists, green-campaigners, daily office commuters who use buses and trains, for example.

User Requirements and Expectations
----------------------------------

Based on sample based assesment, the users expect:

*   One stop website for all shared mobility needs, for example commute to work or to a friends party using traditional public/shared transportation.
*   Plan journeys using shared electric cycles, or along with traditional public transport services.
*   Info on benefits of using shared electric cycles.
*   Info on coverage of shared electric cycles in any given area.
*   Based on the Journey Planer, the user can then book their journey on our partners website.
*   Engagement on the use of frequent shared electric vehicles through the newsletter.
*   Info on costs of using a shared electric vehicle.

User Stories
------------

This website was created based on the feedback of commuter based in London who wasnt aware of the the benefits of shared electric cycles. This website is created to address the gap.

3\. Design
==========

This section will address questions relating to design choices, colors, fonts, structure and wireframe.

Design Choice:The design choice is guided by two projects reviewed during Module 1 of Full Stack Boot Camp:  
1\. Love running  
2\. Love Rosie.

ColorsWe used Coolers color template to generate the following pallete to ensure there is adequate color contrat.

![Coolers Color Pallete to ensure accessibility](Assets\Images\Eclectic Cycles.png)

Fonts: We have used Robeto and Xo sourced from Google Fonts. We used global inherited size for h1, h2 and h3 and p mostly. We used additional weights

Structure: We have used the concept of containers to organize the layout. Each container called row is created under each section and within each section we have created a number of coloumns. The column width is based on Flex to ensure visibility is based on viewport width. This ensures mobile responsivness.

Wireframe: We created a wireframe of the website using Balsamiq online tool.

![website wireframe](Assets\Images\Wireframe.png) Other Stylistic Considerations

*   Hero Image - Man riding the cycle
*   Font Family - Exo, Robeto.
*   Display is Flex
*   Navbar: Padding is 2% 4%
*   Nav Links: text align= right, flex = 1
*   Nav Links UL LI: List-style = none, display = inline block, padding = 8px, 12px, position = relative.
*   Logo: Border 2PX, Red, Solid, Opacity: 0.9%

    The text and button size is also based on viewport width (i.e. "vw"), this ensures the size approriateness for mobile and desktop views
    
6.  Partners Page
    -------------
    
    This section provides information about Partners. You will notice each partner has hover feature so it glows when the pointer appears over it. Further an embeded image, which has responsive size, also provides some context about the cycles they provide.
    
Also, provides users with a summary of each particpants offering.

Furthermore, it provides users with a summary of where the participants home territory is.

10.  Footer section with Contact Us, Form to Signup and QR Code
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    
    Please note, there is a bug in the code, as the section is not vertically aligning. This is in the desktop view. We have used Flex-basis: 33% and vertical-align: top. However, this is not a problem in Mobile view.
